Lists

What are the collections which implements serializable ?

One difference between arraylist and vector in terms of capacity?
Linked list,vector and ArrayList

question--
What is iterator and what it will return?
We can remove elements while using iterator?
Ans-- Iterator implements Iterable interface which allows the object which is implementing it to be iterated.


List iterator

** Set
--> entry set
--> If we want to add objects to set the object class must override the hashcode and equals method.
**HashSet & LinkedHashSet
-->
** TreeSet 
-->If we want object in Treeset , the class must implement comparable interface and it should override the method of it.
--> So, hashcode,equals and compareTo shd be overrided to implement TreeSet

**Map
-->it does not implement collection interface 
**HashMap & LinkedHashMap
-->
**HashTable
-->
**TreeMap
-->
**Dictionaries
-->

 ** 
 comparator
 --> it is a interface
 --> the way of disconnecting the sorting algorithm with the main class
 -->customized sorting can be done using comparator
 
 ** conversions 
 ArrayList to array
 Array to arraylist
 set to list 
 list to set
 entryset method in set
 maps inside map
